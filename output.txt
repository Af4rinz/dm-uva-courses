{'Objectives': 'The students will learn about historical developments in the history of the Low Countries that led to the founding of the Dutch Republic. \nThey will acquire a general knowledge of the main developments in this crucial period of the country in a wide range of topics, such as political thinking, art and literature. \nThey will be able to recognize, identify and analyze specific elements of Dutch 17th century culture. \nThey will be able to describe the influences and significance of the Golden Age for today’s society and be able to understand and to critically relate to the meaning of the Golden Age for the Dutch national identity.', 'Contents': 'The so called Golden Age, which corresponds roughly with the 17th century, was an extremely important period in Dutch history. The enormous increase in trading activity at that time not only increased social mobility but produced a wealthy merchant class. This merchant class was important for patronage of the arts, literature and science and the merchants were also in a position to influence urban planning and architecture of that time. Topics to be covered in the course include colonialism and trade; scientific discoveries; navigation; the Dutch East India Company and the Amsterdam Bank; tulip fever; the perceived tradition of religious tolerance in the Netherlands; still-life painting; the Dutch political scene and the Dutch Republic in the century Europe. Students will learn about historical developments in the Dutch Republic that made the 17th century such an important period for The Netherlands, the ‘Golden Age’, and will trace the significance of these developments to the present day.', 'Study materials': 'Reader with articles or Textbook (check Canvas)', 'Assessment': 'Exams, participation, presentation, paper (see Canvas)', 'Credits': '6 EC', 'course_title': 'A Golden Age?
