       "      <td>Although the originality of a work of literature or art has often been privileged as the main criterion for evaluation, writers, playwrights, filmmakers and artists have always looked to previous works for inspiration. Adaptation, in other words, has always played a leading role within literature and culture as a primary mode of creative transfer and production. Arguably, globalization and advancing technologies have made (and are making) processes of adaptation increasingly complex, by increasing the scope and modes of reception and interaction across cultures and genres and platforms.\\n\\nThis class examines the theory and the practice of adaptation. We will consider adaptation as a cultural product (primarily using case studies from literature and film, but also including theatre, art, media, etc.) and as a cultural process, in which an existing work is adapted to another medium or form, or to another context or culture. We attempt to do so from an interdisciplinary and global perspective, drawing on the experience and interests of our group.\\n\\nIn the introductory part of the course, we will explore possible frameworks for analyzing adaptation. Students will be introduced to a) the main issues and debates involved in adaptation studies and b) some of the primary “tools” that have been proposed for the study of adaptations.\\n\\nThroughout the course we will:\\n\\n- attempt to move beyond (i) the idea that adaptations and their ‘source’ texts represent a singular and one- directional line of influence from past to present; and (ii) the kind of comparative reviews that focus on ‘good’ originals and ‘bad’ adaptations;\\n\\n- interrogate the dialogue between multiple versions of a narrative ‘pre-text’ (i.e. our case studies): how and why do adaptations modify their sources in a particular way? How are stories adapted to particular\\n\\naesthetic, commercial, technical, social, or political demands – and are particular modes (e.g. film, novels, games…) more suited than others for these purposes? How do adaptations move across different cultures, genres, and time periods?\\n\\nWith the case study adaptations as our points of departure, we will consider different approaches to and theorizations of adaptation and examine various relevant notions, such as originality, fidelity, authenticity, universality, history, canon, and genre. Throughout the course, students will be asked to bring in their own examples of adaptations to discuss in class.\\n All of the following:\\n60 EC\\nIntroduction to Literary and Cultural Theory\\nRegistration\\nThis course is only open to AUC students.\\n Students will be able to understand and analyze the dynamics at play concerning the theory and practice of adaptation. They will be familiar with the terminology and theory with which to study adaptations and will be able to consider adaptation within a broader cultural context. Students will improve their analytical skills and their ability to work on research projects, both individually and collaboratively. Finally, students will develop an interdisciplinary and international approach, engaging with different fields of study from both a local and a global perspective.\\n Main sources:\\nJane Austen, Pride and Prejudice\\nLewis Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland\\nAhmed Saadawi, Frankenstein in Baghdad\\nJohn Luther Long, Madame Butterfly\\nAndrea Dunbar, The Arbor\\nSelected Academic Essays/Chapters\\nSeveral Films\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>The goal of this course is to gain insight into the etiology and the neurobiology of addictive behaviour. The course explores various topics in the study of drug addiction. The primary emphasis is on psychological and biological theories of drug addiction. Genetic and personality traits representing risk factors for the development of addiction will be identified. Other important topics are clinical diagnosis and treatment. Psychomotor stimulant (e.g. amphetamine, cocaine) and opiate (e.g. heroin, morphine) drugs, but also the more socially accepted drugs nicotine and alcohol, figure prominently in an examination of the pharmacological properties of addictive drugs. Much of the course relates the important mood-elevating effects of these drugs to their biological actions. However, non-drug related addictions, such as gambling and obsessive eating will also be discussed.\\n\\nWe will also address the huge impact of addiction on our society and the effectiveness of drug policies.\\n\\n One of the following:\\nBrain and Cognition\\nMedicinal Chemistry\\nBrain &amp; Mind\\nRegistration\\nThis course is only open to AUC students.\\n • The student understands basic pharmacological principles that explain drug actions.\\n• The student is able to understand how different drugs of abuse exert their acute actions in our brain.\\n• The student has knowledge of the diagnostic criteria and the current theories of addiction\\n• The student is able to explain the contribution of genetic, environmental and personality factors to the development and persistence of addictive behavior.\\n• The student is able to understand some of the neurobiological mechanisms that may explain the persistent character of addiction\\n• The student gains insight into the huge impact addiction has on our society.\\n• The student learns about the current treatment options that are available to drug addicts.\\n• The student understands the pros and cons of current drug policies and is able to defend them in a debate.\\n• The student can conduct a literature search and is able to collect, summarize and interpret information.

       "0  The so called Golden Age, which corresponds roughly with the 17th century, was an extremely important period in Dutch history. The enormous increase in trading activity at that time not only increased social mobility but produced a wealthy merchant class. This merchant class was important for patronage of the arts, literature and science and the merchants were also in a position to influence urban planning and architecture of that time. Topics to be covered in the course include colonialism and trade; scientific discoveries; navigation; the Dutch East India Company and the Amsterdam Bank; tulip fever; the perceived tradition of religious tolerance in the Netherlands; still-life painting; the Dutch political scene and the Dutch Republic in the century Europe. Students will learn about historical developments in the Dutch Republic that made the 17th century such an important period for The Netherlands, the ‘Golden Age’, and will trace the significance of these developments to the present day.\\n  The students will learn about historical developments in the history of the Low Countries that led to the founding of the Dutch Republic. \\nThey will acquire a general knowledge of the main developments in this crucial period of the country in a wide range of topics, such as political thinking, art and literature. \\nThey will be able to recognize, identify and analyze specific elements of Dutch 17th century culture. \\nThey will be able to describe the influences and significance of the Golden Age for today’s society and be able to understand and to critically relate to the meaning of the Golden Age for the Dutch national identity.\\n Reader with articles or Textbook (check Canvas)\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "2  Although the originality of a work of literature or art has often been privileged as the main criterion for evaluation, writers, playwrights, filmmakers and artists have always looked to previous works for inspiration. Adaptation, in other words, has always played a leading role within literature and culture as a primary mode of creative transfer and production. Arguably, globalization and advancing technologies have made (and are making) processes of adaptation increasingly complex, by increasing the scope and modes of reception and interaction across cultures and genres and platforms.\\n\\nThis class examines the theory and the practice of adaptation. We will consider adaptation as a cultural product (primarily using case studies from literature and film, but also including theatre, art, media, etc.) and as a cultural process, in which an existing work is adapted to another medium or form, or to another context or culture. We attempt to do so from an interdisciplinary and global perspective, drawing on the experience and interests of our group.\\n\\nIn the introductory part of the course, we will explore possible frameworks for analyzing adaptation. Students will be introduced to a) the main issues and debates involved in adaptation studies and b) some of the primary “tools” that have been proposed for the study of adaptations.\\n\\nThroughout the course we will:\\n\\n- attempt to move beyond (i) the idea that adaptations and their ‘source’ texts represent a singular and one- directional line of influence from past to present; and (ii) the kind of comparative reviews that focus on ‘good’ originals and ‘bad’ adaptations;\\n\\n- interrogate the dialogue between multiple versions of a narrative ‘pre-text’ (i.e. our case studies): how and why do adaptations modify their sources in a particular way? How are stories adapted to particular\\n\\naesthetic, commercial, technical, social, or political demands – and are particular modes (e.g. film, novels, games…) more suited than others for these purposes? How do adaptations move across different cultures, genres, and time periods?\\n\\nWith the case study adaptations as our points of departure, we will consider different approaches to and theorizations of adaptation and examine various relevant notions, such as originality, fidelity, authenticity, universality, history, canon, and genre. Throughout the course, students will be asked to bring in their own examples of adaptations to discuss in class.\\n All of the following:\\n60 EC\\nIntroduction to Literary and Cultural Theory\\nRegistration\\nThis course is only open to AUC students.\\n Students will be able to understand and analyze the dynamics at play concerning the theory and practice of adaptation. They will be familiar with the terminology and theory with which to study adaptations and will be able to consider adaptation within a broader cultural context. Students will improve their analytical skills and their ability to work on research projects, both individually and collaboratively. Finally, students will develop an interdisciplinary and international approach, engaging with different fields of study from both a local and a global perspective.\\n Main sources:\\nJane Austen, Pride and Prejudice\\nLewis Carroll, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland\\nAhmed Saadawi, Frankenstein in Baghdad\\nJohn Luther Long, Madame Butterfly\\nAndrea Dunbar, The Arbor\\nSelected Academic Essays/Chapters\\nSeveral Films\\n   \n",
       "3  The goal of this course is to gain insight into the etiology and the neurobiology of addictive behaviour. The course explores various topics in the study of drug addiction. The primary emphasis is on psychological and biological theories of drug addiction. Genetic and personality traits representing risk factors for the development of addiction will be identified. Other important topics are clinical diagnosis and treatment. Psychomotor stimulant (e.g. amphetamine, cocaine) and opiate (e.g. heroin, morphine) drugs, but also the more socially accepted drugs nicotine and alcohol, figure prominently in an examination of the pharmacological properties of addictive drugs. Much of the course relates the important mood-elevating effects of these drugs to their biological actions. However, non-drug related addictions, such as gambling and obsessive eating will also be discussed.\\n\\nWe will also address the huge impact of addiction on our society and the effectiveness of drug policies.\\n\\n One of the following:\\nBrain and Cognition\\nMedicinal Chemistry\\nBrain & Mind\\nRegistration\\nThis course is only open to AUC students.\\n • The student understands basic pharmacological principles that explain drug actions.\\n• The student is able to understand how different drugs of abuse exert their acute actions in our brain.\\n• The student has knowledge of the diagnostic criteria and the current theories of addiction\\n• The student is able to explain the contribution of genetic, environmental and personality factors to the development and persistence of addictive behavior.\\n• The student is able to understand some of the neurobiological mechanisms that may explain the persistent character of addiction\\n• The student gains insight into the huge impact addiction has on our society.\\n• The student learns about the current treatment options that are available to drug addicts.\\n• The student understands the pros and cons of current drug policies and is able to defend them in a debate.\\n• The student can conduct a literature search and is able to collect, summarize and interpret information.
