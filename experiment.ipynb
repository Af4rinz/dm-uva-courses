      "The way the modern world since the 19th century has created wealth and prosperity--a carbon-based economy--has caused ecological and climatological problems so severe that most of this progress will be at risk for people all over the world in this century. This is the great paradox, and challenge, of our time: what has made many people thrive, and what others hope will do the same for them, now threatens most of what has been accomplished.\n",
      " \n",
      "As humanity has become aware of the threat, there has been a close connection between on the one hand, what happens locally, regionally, and nationally, and, on the other hand, what individuals, groups, and governments have been able to accomplish inter- and transnationally.\n",
      " \n",
      "Without a scientific consensus there can be no basis for action; without local and transnational activism, there's little incentive for meaningful diplomacy. These three aspects: emergence of a scientific consensus on the important environmental and climate challenges; civil society activism, but also skepticism and denial; and international diplomacy will be central in this course for the period since the 1960s. In light of the global nature of the challenges, the emphasis will be on international and transnational aspects.\n",
      " \n",
      "This is a history course. As historians we believe that contemporary challenges cannot be understood without knowledge of their history, and that historical thinking is indispensable as a basis for meaningful action in the present. The recent history of action and inaction on environmental and climate questions is particularly contested, and it will be one of our tasks to grapple with it. History will not provide simple prescriptions for action on the difficult questions. Still, the goal for the research projects is to find convincing ways to have historical research inform present-day debates.\n",

      "Students will be able to understand and analyze the dynamics at play concerning the theory and practice of adaptation. They will be familiar with the terminology and theory with which to study adaptations and will be able to consider adaptation within a broader cultural context. Students will improve their analytical skills and their ability to work on research projects, both individually and collaboratively. Finally, students will develop an interdisciplinary and international approach, engaging with different fields of study from both a local and a global perspective.\n",
      "Contents\n",
      "Although the originality of a work of literature or art has often been privileged as the main criterion for evaluation, writers, playwrights, filmmakers and artists have always looked to previous works for inspiration. Adaptation, in other words, has always played a leading role within literature and culture as a primary mode of creative transfer and production. Arguably, globalization and advancing technologies have made (and are making) processes of adaptation increasingly complex, by increasing the scope and modes of reception and interaction across cultures and genres and platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "This class examines the theory and the practice of adaptation. We will consider adaptation as a cultural product (primarily using case studies from literature and film, but also including theatre, art, media, etc.) and as a cultural process, in which an existing work is adapted to another medium or form, or to another context or culture. We attempt to do so from an interdisciplinary and global perspective, drawing on the experience and interests of our group.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the introductory part of the course, we will explore possible frameworks for analyzing adaptation. Students will be introduced to a) the main issues and debates involved in adaptation studies and b) some of the primary “tools” that have been proposed for the study of adaptations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the course we will:\n",
      "\n",
      "- attempt to move beyond (i) the idea that adaptations and their ‘source’ texts represent a singular and one- directional line of influence from past to present; and (ii) the kind of comparative reviews that focus on ‘good’ originals and ‘bad’ adaptations;\n",
      "\n",
      "- interrogate the dialogue between multiple versions of a narrative ‘pre-text’ (i.e. our case studies): how and why do adaptations modify their sources in a particular way? How are stories adapted to particular\n",
      "\n",
      "aesthetic, commercial, technical, social, or political demands – and are particular modes (e.g. film, novels, games…) more suited than others for these purposes? How do adaptations move across different cultures, genres, and time periods?\n",
      "\n",
      "With the case study adaptations as our points of departure, we will consider different approaches to and theorizations of adaptation and examine various relevant notions, such as originality, fidelity, authenticity, universality, history, canon, and genre. Throughout the course, students will be asked to bring in their own examples of adaptations to discuss in class.\n",
